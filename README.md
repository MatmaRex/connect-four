This is a simple [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game.

You can play against a friend or a computer player, or watch two computer players test each other's
wits. (They're not very smart.)

It should be compatible with all modern desktop and mobile browsers. Even IE6 and IE8 are mostly
supported, thanks to jQuery 1.11 and es5-shim.
